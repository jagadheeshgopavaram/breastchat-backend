A mammogram is a specialized medical imaging technique that uses low-dose X-rays to examine breast tissue.  
It is primarily used to detect early signs of breast cancer before physical symptoms appear.  
The procedure helps identify abnormalities such as lumps, microcalcifications, or changes in breast structure.  
Mammograms are crucial for early diagnosis, especially in women over the age of 40 or those with a family history of breast cancer.  
There are two main types: screening mammograms for routine checks and diagnostic mammograms for investigating specific issues.  
During the test, the breast is compressed between two plates to spread the tissue for a clearer image.  
Though slightly uncomfortable, the process is quick and typically lasts about 15 minutes.  
Doctors review the images for any unusual masses or patterns that might suggest a problem.  
Early detection through mammography can significantly increase the chances of successful treatment.  
It is recommended to have regular mammograms every 1â€“2 years depending on age and risk factors.
